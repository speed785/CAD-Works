# Summary

A simple Ender series LCD Cover. No supports/glue needed.
Printing orientation is as shown in the picture.

It can be a one-piece design but I really don't like to print flat things with supports, that would be really painful to remove them. So I turned it into 2 pieces and add a clip to combine them without glue.

Happy printing!
