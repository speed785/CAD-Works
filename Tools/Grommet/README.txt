# Summary

I designed a new cable guide, because i didn't like the design of most of them.

This one comes with a <b>non-standard thread</b> to really tighten it to your table.

The minimum clamping height is 47,50 mm,
maximum clamping height is round about 55 mm.

Inner hole diameter is big enough to get a standard <b>STRAIGHT</b> shock-proof plug (safety plug) through.
Outer diameter is 50 mm, so you will need to drill a hole through your table using a core hole drill/saw

When the thread does not fit at the beginning: Srew/unscrew a few times. With every process a little further. Use some oil (like silicone oil) when it is really tight.

Got problems or suggestions?
============
**Tell me in the comments. I will help you with this, if I can. If you need a special type of this model, please ask and I will try my best to suit your needs with a new design! ;-)**

Let me know if you made one!
