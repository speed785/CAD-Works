# Summary

Wanted a nice space for my artisan keycaps so designed a quick drawer system.

Drawers have 0.5mm clearance on every side.

Slots are 20mm x 20mm x 20mm so should fit most caps.

There are magnet holes on the bottom of the drawers and slots to keep the drawers in place. They are sized for 6x3 magnets 

Holes in the back are for easier opening of drawers.

Drawer insert isn't necessary, just another layer for keeping the caps in place.


Very long print time. ~29 hours for the outside box, ~6 hours for each drawer, and ~3 hours for the inserts.
